The dashboard is now [deployed](http://r4ds.io/mentordash)!

Please note that the 'mentordash' project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We roughly follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), with the exception that we borrow the Google convention of prefixing unexported functions with ".". For example, while golem defaults to `app_ui` for the main unexported UI function, we renamed this to `.ui_main`.
