# mentordash 0.4.0

* Links now point to the app, rather than the website, since the website does not always allow linking to specific questions.

# mentordash 0.3.7

* The app has been in a working state for a while now with no news updates! The latest change was to use an HttpOnly cookie, which removes the need for any JavaScript handlers.

# mentordash 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Updated for new custom status emoji.
* The code returned by Slack is now removed after it has been processed, so refresh mostly works.
